# Portfolio
This is Day 3 Challenge
# Description
What was my motivation?
My motivations was to learn how to use Javascript, and learning how to make a website for it.
Why did you build this project?
I built this project to learn how to manage names and money in a grid on Javascript. To help me get an idea on how to be organized.
What problems does it solve?
The problems it sloves is when clicking on the grind it will slove on who name you put in, how much money they are getting and see who win in a random alert.
What did I learn?
What I learned was creat an input to create and return employee objects. I also learned how to display average salary and random employee.
What makes your project stand out?
My project stands out with my random and salary showing up in the console.

# Installation
What I did was open git labs, and I made a git clone of the challenges I had to do into a separate folder, which I then made into my Challenges folder. After that, I went into my git hub, created repositories for my portfolio, and connected them with my challenges folder using git bash. I also created my assets folder there. Then, I open the folder using Visual Studio code to make my javascript to use my project. I used my git bash to add commit my work and pushed each time I made something new in my Portfolio. I made the layouts of my portfolio on what it looks like in my html then I added images and text to the website as well. and then I used my style.css to make my text, padding, margins, colors, links, and background images.
